Miami-Dade Elections Parser

See it in action here: http://local-elections.herokuapp.com

I'm interested in local elections. Miami-Dade County provides great data on election nights, but their website leaves a lot to be desired, and is a chore to use on mobile.

On election night 2016 I quickly wrote this to parse and present the election data from Miami-Dade County in a mobile-friendly format for me to refresh on the go.

Will it work for the next election? Probably, as they've been using the same format for the past two elections.

Please note that the results for state and national contests only reflect votes cast in Miami-Dade County.
